# Clocktime Example for Test Driven Development
This code was used for a lecture for students of the master degree course of computer science at the [University of Applied Sciences Zittau / Görlitz](http://f-ei.hszg.de/). It was used as an exercise to show the approach of *Test Driven Development*. 
The task was used from the german book [**"Das Java-Praktikum"**](http://sol.cs.hm.edu/dpunkt-java-praktikum/) ([dpunkt.verlag](http://www.dpunkt.de/), 2008, from *Reinhard Schiedermeier* and *Klaus Köhler*).

The exercise was to write a class that encapsulates a specific point in time and gives the user an easy way to handle and visualize this instance of time.
